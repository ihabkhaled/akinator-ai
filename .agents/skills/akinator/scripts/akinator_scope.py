"""Scope a pass to what actually changed, and budget the questions.

Stage 7 of the v2 pipeline, and the one that decides whether the other six get
used. If a full pass costs the same on a typo as on a release, people stop
running it - and that is how this discipline dies in every repository where it
dies.

**"Everything" means every station, not every file.** The stations are not
skipped; they are *scoped*. On a comment typo most of them have nothing to do
and the batch records `knowledge delta: none, because ...` in one line. On a
migration, ops and business wake up and the pass is long. The command is the
same either way; the work is not.

Two budgets, both enforced, because both have a hard human limit:

    token budget      the brief's cap - see skills/everything/scripts/build_brief.py
    interrupt budget  at most N questions per session, batched and ranked

The owner asked for MANY questions every prompt (ADR 0010): the default budget
is 15, asked as ONE grouped message, ranked, each with a recommended default so
"go with recommendations" is always a valid answer. The budget still exists -
it is what keeps fifteen questions one message instead of fifteen interruptions -
and a repository can lower it in .ai/config.json.

Usage:
    python skills/everything/scripts/akinator_scope.py plan [--against HEAD]
    python skills/everything/scripts/akinator_scope.py questions [--limit 5]

Exit codes:
    0  scoped successfully
    2  the tool could not run
