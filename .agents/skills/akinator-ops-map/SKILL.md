# Akinator Ops Map - operational consequence ships with the change

The developer who makes a schema change knows that this one needs a container
rebuild rather than a restart. Nobody else does. Three weeks later someone
restarts the service, the stale image serves the old schema, and an hour is spent
debugging a problem that was solved and never written down.

**If a change alters how the system is operated, the procedure is written the
moment the change is made** - not when someone next needs it, because by then the
person who knew is gone or has forgotten.

## When to use

The change touches any of:

- Database schema, migrations, seed data.
- Dependencies - a new package, a version bump, a lockfile change.
- Build inputs - Dockerfile, base image, build args, compiled assets.
- Configuration or environment variables, especially ones read at boot.
- Service topology - a new service, a renamed one, a changed port or network.
- Anything with an ordering constraint between services.
- Anything whose failure needs a recovery or rollback path.

## When NOT to use

- Code-only changes to an already-running service where a restart (or hot reload)
  fully picks them up, and no existing runbook changes.
- Purely local developer preference with no shared consequence.

## Procedure

### 1. Classify the operational consequence

This classification is the single most valuable thing in the runbook, because it
is what people get wrong:

| Change type | Correct action | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Code only, interpreted or mounted | **restart** the service | The image is unchanged; a rebuild wastes minutes for nothing |
| Code only, compiled into the image | **rebuild** that service | The running image does not contain the change |
| Dependency change (lockfile, package manifest) | **rebuild** - full `stop`, `rm`, `rmi`, `build` | Layer caches will otherwise serve the old dependency set |
| Schema or migration | **drop the container and rebuild the service**, then run the migration in the documented order | Stale containers hold connections and cached metadata against the old schema |
| Config or env read at boot | **restart** with the new value; **rebuild** if the value is baked at build time | Depends on whether it is a build arg or a runtime env |
| Service added, renamed, or ports changed | Rebuild the changed service, then dependents | Dependents resolve topology at connect time |

Prefer `restart` over rebuild wherever it is genuinely sufficient. The full
`stop -> rm -> rmi -> build` cycle is expensive and is reserved for dependency
and schema changes.

### 2. Get the ordering and the parallelism right

State both, explicitly, for every multi-service procedure:

- **What is independent** - services with no dependency on each other rebuild
  **in parallel**. Saying so is what turns a twenty-minute procedure into a
  five-minute one.
- **What is dependent** - dependents go **after** the thing they depend on,
  sequentially. Name the dependency, not just the order, so the reader can adapt
  when the topology changes.
- **What must never be parallel** - migrations against the same database, anything
  contending for one exclusive resource, anything that would double-write.

A runbook that does not say which steps are parallel-safe will be executed
serially forever, and one that does not say which are not will eventually be
executed concurrently and corrupt something.

### 3. Write the runbook

Use the repo's runbook conventions, or Akinator's ops-runbook template. It
states:

- **Trigger** - "when X happens or changes". Written so someone can tell from the
  outside whether this runbook applies to their situation.
- **Preconditions** - what must be true before starting, and how to check each
  one. The step that fails is always the one whose precondition was assumed.
- **Procedure** - numbered, with the **exact commands**, not descriptions of
  commands. Parallel-versus-sequential called out per step.
- **Verification** - how to know it worked, per step and at the end. Observable
  facts, not "it should be up".
- **Rollback** - how to get back, and the point after which rollback is no longer
  possible. Name that point of no return explicitly; it is the most important
  sentence in a migration runbook.
- **Duration and blast radius** - roughly how long, and what is unavailable while
  it runs.

### 4. Skillify it

The runbook is the reference; the skill is what makes it fire when it is needed
(`akinator-skillify`). A runbook nobody remembers to look for is not much better
than no runbook.

### 5. Respect the machine

Operational procedures run on real machines, often a developer's. Before starting
anything heavy, check load. One long job at a time; never race a build against a
test suite. See `akinator-resource-guard`.

### 6. Index and sync

Reachable from the ops index and reflected in the routers.

## Failure modes and pitfalls

- **Rebuilding when a restart would do.** Minutes per occurrence, forever.
- **Restarting when a rebuild was needed.** Worse: the change appears not to have
  worked, and the next hour goes to debugging a phantom.
- **Not stating parallelism.** The default becomes serial, and nobody knows it
  was safe to parallelize.
- **Describing commands instead of writing them.** "Rebuild the service" is not
  a procedure. The command is.
- **No verification step.** The procedure completes and nobody knows whether it
  worked until a user reports it.
- **No point of no return.** Someone attempts a rollback after the migration
  dropped a column.
- **Writing the runbook later.** The ordering detail that matters is the one you
  currently hold in your head and will not tomorrow.

## Definition of done

- [ ] The operational consequence is classified: restart, rebuild, or full drop
      and rebuild - with the reason.
- [ ] Ordering is stated, with the dependency named, not just the sequence.
- [ ] Parallel-safe steps are marked parallel-safe; must-not-be-parallel steps
      are marked as such.
- [ ] The runbook has trigger, preconditions, exact commands, verification,
      rollback and point of no return.
- [ ] A skill exists so the runbook fires when the situation arises.
- [ ] The runbook is reachable from an index and reflected in the routers.
