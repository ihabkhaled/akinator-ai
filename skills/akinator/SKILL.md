name: akinator
description: Use when touching a codebase in any way - planning, exploring, auditing, refactoring, implementing, fixing, upgrading, deleting or documenting. Runs the twelve-station Akinator loop so every change ships with the knowledge that lets the next agent act on it in seconds. Ask everything, document everything, skillify everything, rule everything.

# Akinator

The code outlives its context. Every contributor - human or AI - pays a
re-derivation tax to rediscover what someone already knew. On an AI-heavy team
that tax is paid *per session*: an agent with a fresh context window is a new
hire every morning.

Akinator removes the tax by making the knowledge layer inseparable from the
change that needs it.

## The creed

1. **A change is never the code alone.** A change is the code plus the knowledge
   that lets the next agent act on it in seconds. Half a change is no change.
2. **Ask more.** An unasked question becomes an unrecorded assumption becomes a
   production bug. Ask at intake, record every answer, and convert every answer
   into a permanent artifact so it never needs asking again.
3. **Skillify everything.** Any procedure that will happen twice gets a skill
   the first time. Creating skills is the default, not the exception.
4. **Rule everything.** Any constraint others must not break becomes a written,
   enforced rule - not a comment, not a review remark, not tribal memory.
5. **Document every single detail - but only true ones.** A stale doc is worse
   than no doc, because it is trusted. Every doc change is verified against the
   tree it describes.
6. **Contextify.** Structural facts (who owns what, what talks to what, where a
   kind of code lives) live in machine-checkable maps, regenerated, never
   hand-drifted.
7. **Memoize.** Durable facts, preferences, decisions and surprises go into
   persistent memory with their *why*, their date, and their reversal conditions.
8. **The routers stay in sync.** CLAUDE.md, CODEX.md, AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md,
   cursor rules - every AI entry-point file reflects the same truth, updated in
   the same commit, never allowed to fork.
9. **Business logic is first-class knowledge.** Pricing, quotas, entitlements,
   refunds, product semantics - written in business language, next to the
   technical contract, so "what should the product do?" never requires reading
   the implementation.
10. **Operational consequence ships with the change.** If a change alters how the
    system is operated, the procedure is written the moment the change is made.
11. **Gate once, gate late, gate narrow.** Never burn the machine proving the
    same thing twice.
12. **Evidence over claims.** "Documented" means a newcomer test passes: a fresh
    agent, given only the knowledge layer, knows where to go, what to do, how to
    fix, and what will bite - in seconds. Anything less is not done.

## The loop

Every codebase touch runs these twelve stations. Each station has a skill; this
skill is the router.

| # | Station | What happens | Skill |
|---|---------|--------------|-------|
| 1 | ASK | Intake questions; surface every unknown | `akinator-intake` |
| 2 | RESOLVE | Load context: routers, rules, skills, context, memory, `.ai`, docs | this skill |
| 3 | AUDIT | Claim vs code: done / partial / missing; present-is-not-wired | `akinator-audit` |
| 4 | PLAN | Batches, blast radius, **knowledge delta declared up front per batch** | `akinator-plan` |
| 5 | IMPLEMENT | The code | domain skills |
| 6 | DOCUMENT | The why, the when-not-to, the business meaning, the operational consequence | `akinator-document-change` |
| 7 | SKILLIFY | Any repeatable procedure becomes a skill | `akinator-skillify` |
| 8 | RULE | Any new constraint becomes an enforced rule | `akinator-rule-forge` |
| 9 | CONTEXTIFY | Structural maps updated or regenerated | `akinator-contextify` |
| 10 | MEMOIZE | Decisions, surprises, preferences | `akinator-memoize` |
| 11 | INDEX+SYNC | Every artifact reachable; all routers updated in the same change | `akinator-index-sync`, `akinator-router-sync` |
| 12 | VERIFY | Gate once, scoped; newcomer test; land | `akinator-gate-economy`, `akinator-coverage` |

### The all-in-one pass

When the work is worth maximum thoroughness - a release, a handover, an audit, a
change too expensive to get wrong - or when the user asks for everything, load
`akinator-everything`. It runs every station, every applicable boardroom lens and
every mechanical check, and loops until the Definition of Done is proven rather
than asserted. It is what the `/akinator` command runs by default.

This skill scales the loop to the change; that one does not scale down.

### Non-negotiables

- **Stations 6-11 are not optional and not deferrable.** They happen in the same
  batch as station 5, before the batch is called done. "I'll document in a
  follow-up" is a prohibited sentence.
- **The knowledge delta is declared at station 4.** The plan for any batch names
  the docs, skills, rules, context and memory files it will touch, so skipping
  them is visible, not silent.
- **A batch with zero knowledge delta must state why none applied** - explicitly,
  in the plan and in the commit message. Silence is a violation.
- **Deletion is a documentation event.** Removing behavior removes or updates
  every doc that described it. Stale docs describing deleted behavior are
  severity-critical.

## When to use

Load on any intent that touches a codebase: add, fix, refactor, upgrade, remove,
investigate, review, plan, document, "why does X", onboard. It is the default
operating mode, not a special path.

## When NOT to use

- Pure conversation with no repository consequence ("what does this error mean in
  general?", "explain how OAuth works").
- Read-only questions the knowledge layer already answers - answer from the layer
  and cite where, which is itself proof the layer works.
- Inside a subagent dispatched to execute one narrow step: the dispatching
  session owns the loop; the subagent does its step.

## Procedure

### Station 2 first: RESOLVE before anything

Read in this order, stopping when the question is answered:

1. **Routers** - `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CODEX.md`, and any per-module router
   in the directory you are about to touch. These are indexes: follow their links.
2. **Rules** - `rules/` (or the repo's equivalent). These are constraints you may
   not break. Read the ones that apply to the area you are touching.
3. **Skills** - the repo's own `skills/`. If a runbook exists for what you are
   about to do, follow it instead of improvising.
4. **Context maps** - `context/` for structural facts: ownership, ports, routes,
   events, permissions.
5. **Memory** - `memory/` for durable decisions, preferences and surprises.
6. **Generated manifests** - `.ai/` for machine-readable derived facts.
7. **Docs** - `docs/` for narrative: architecture, business, product, ops, ADRs.

If the repo has none of these, you are on a greenfield target: say so and offer
`/akinator onboard` rather than silently inventing a structure.

### Then run the stations

Route each station to its skill. Do not skip forward past station 4 without a
written knowledge delta, and do not declare a batch done before station 11.

### Adopt, never impose

If the target repo already has a knowledge system - its own `rules/` numbering,
its own docs conventions, a generated `.ai` layer - map Akinator's taxonomy onto
what exists and extend it. Never create a parallel competing structure. Detection
first, convention-matching always.

## The knowledge taxonomy

One canonical home per kind of knowledge. Route every fact to its home.

| Kind of knowledge | Canonical home | Never lives in |
|---|---|---|
| Hard constraints (must / never) | `rules/NN-*.md`, numbered, each with an enforcement mechanism | comments, PR remarks, chat |
| Repeatable procedures | `skills/*/SKILL.md` with when-to-use, steps, DoD | one-off shell history |
| Structural facts | `context/*.md` maps, regenerated where possible | prose docs that drift |
| Architecture and deep dives | `docs/` | README sprawl |
| Business logic (pricing, plans, quotas, refunds, entitlements) | `docs/business/` | the implementation |
| Product logic (intent, acceptance criteria, edge cases) | `docs/product/` per feature | ticket systems that rot |
| Operational procedure | `docs/ops/` runbooks plus the relevant skill | on-call memory |
| Decisions with alternatives | ADRs in `docs/adr/` | commit messages alone |
| Durable facts and surprises | `memory/` with date, why, reversal conditions | session context |
| Machine-readable derived facts | `.ai/` manifests, generated only | hand-edited JSON |
| Agent entry points | routers - thin indexes that link, never mirror | 2,000-line monoliths |
| Per-module constraints | `<module>/CLAUDE.md` plus generated `<module>/AGENTS.md` | the root router |

Taxonomy laws:

1. **One home per fact.** Duplicated prose forks; the second copy is a link.
2. **Every artifact reachable from an index.** Unindexed means nonexistent.
3. **Generated beats written** wherever a fact can be extracted from the tree.
4. **Every doc states what would make it stale.**

## Failure modes and pitfalls

- **Documenting the what instead of the why.** Restating what the code plainly
  does adds bytes and no knowledge. Write the why, the when-not-to, the
  consequence, the rejected alternative.
- **Deferring stations 6-11 to a follow-up.** The follow-up never happens. The
  batch is not done.
- **Creating a parallel structure** in a repo that already had conventions.
- **Fake compliance** - vacuous docs, copy-pasted skills, rules with no
  enforcement mechanism, ticked checklists. Worse than absence, because they are
  trusted. See `akinator-anti-gaming`.
- **Gate storms** - running lint, typecheck, test and build after every edit. See
  `akinator-gate-economy`.
- **Asking questions the layer already answers.** Many questions early, near zero
  questions late. Interrupting mid-flow for something `context/` states is a
  failure of station 2, not diligence.
- **Adding knowledge checks to git hooks.** Prohibited, always. Hooks gate
  code and must stay fast; knowledge enforcement lives in CI, in tests and in
  session behavior.

## Definition of done

- [ ] Station 2 was actually run: the layer was read, and answers found there
      were cited rather than re-derived.
- [ ] The plan declared a knowledge delta per batch, or stated why none applied.
- [ ] Every declared artifact exists, is true against the tree, and is reachable
      from an index.
- [ ] All AI router files reflect the same truth, updated in this change.
- [ ] Gates ran once, scoped to what was touched, and are green.
- [ ] A fresh agent given only the knowledge layer could act on this area in
      seconds.
